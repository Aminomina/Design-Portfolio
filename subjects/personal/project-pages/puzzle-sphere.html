                  My girlfriend loves puzzles, so I made her this puzzle sphere
                  for our four-month anniversary. I modeled it in Blender based
                  on measurements from a similar injection molded version of the
                  puzzle that was missing pieces.

                  The most challenging part of the build was ensuring the pieces
                  had enough clearance to assemble, but still fit together
                  snugly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To determine the necessary adjustments, I printed and measured
                  test parts. X and y-axes were consistently a fraction of a
                  millimeter under nominal dimension, which was acceptable. The
                  z-axis was printing about 3% too high, so I adjusted the scale
                  of each piece accordingly, and with minimal sanding, the
                  puzzle assembled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If I were to try printing it again, I might shrink each piece
                  0.5% more, which may allow it to assemble without sanding.
                  Alternatively, I might look into calibration software for my
                  printer.
