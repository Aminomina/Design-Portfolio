                  I built this chest as a wedding gift for two of my closest
                  friends. I was inspired by painted Transylvanian chests and
                  also wanted to try out joinery techniques I was less familiar
                  with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The chest is made with traditional draw-bore mortise and tenon
                  joinery and is painted with homemade linseed oil paint.

                <h2>Designing the Chest</h2>
                <p>
                  The design is based around a skeleton structure containing
                  floating panels. I built extra space into the structure
                  anywhere there was more than a few inches of side grain. This
                  allows for seasonal expansion that might otherwise damage the
                  piece.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the lid, which has intersecting end and side grain, I only
                  glued one end. The other end was pegged into a groove that
                  allows the wood to move in the direction of expansion without
                  loosening the joint. This is a traditional technique called a
                  breadboard end.

                <p>
                  I used a table saw to cut each piece close to its final
                  cross-section and length. Though most of the remaining work
                  was done with hand tools, this saved a lot of time since
                  cutting wood lengthwise with hand tools is difficult and
                  tedious.

                <h2>Mortises and Tenons</h2>
                <p>
                  I chopped out each mortise by hand with a chisel. To keep
                  everything accurate, I first scribed the outline with a sharp
                  knife, then carefully cut the wood fibers around the perimeter
                  of the hole with a chisel. Then I dug each mortise a bit
                  deeper than the length of its corresponding tenon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were about twenty-five mortises of varying shape and
                  size in the design. The easiest way to cut a given width is to
                  use a chisel of the same dimension. Since the tenons can be
                  cut to any width, it's easiest to cut the mortises first and
                  match the tenons to them.

                  I laid out each tenon with a sharp knife, like for the
                  mortises. Then using a ryoba saw, I cut the tenon a bit large.
                  I paired each one down with a chisel to match its
                  corresponding mortise.

                <h2>Handles</h2>
                <p>
                  I decided to make the handles fairly late in the project. I
                  had all the other pieces assembled and realized there was no
                  good way to move the chest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I shaped them from two laminated wood blocks. I chopped out a
                  square handle profile with my hand saw and a large chisel.
                  Using a rasp, I beveled the square cross-section into an
                  octogon which I was able to easily round over into comfortable
                  handles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I drilled four holes in each and used glue and pegs to hold
                  the handles into the main structure of the chest.

                <h2>Draw-Boring and Assembly</h2>
                <p>
                  After trimming everything to final size, I drilled holes
                  through each of the mortises for the pegs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the pegs to “draw” the pieces together, the holes in the
                  tenons need to be offset. I assembled the pieces, marked each,
                  then drilled each hole about 1/16” farther in. This was quite
                  challenging, as hand drilled holes tend to wander. However, I
                  found I could err farther in and use a round file to widen the
                  holes where necessary.
                </p>
                <p>This, combined with glue gave me some very solid joinery.</p>

                <p>
                  I wanted a paint that would give me vibrant colors with a
                  rustic, natural-looking finish. It also had to hold enough
                  detail for me to paint designs onto it. The ability to mix
                  pigments to achieve different colors was also desirable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unable to find anything that quite met my requirements, I
                  researched making my own paint. Before modern furniture paints
                  like alkyd and latex, linseed oil paint was very common. I
                  made my own variety with boiled linseed oil, oxide pigments,
                  calcium carbonate, and mineral spirits. I used a glass muller
                  to fully mix pigments into the oil, the same way artistic oil
                  paints are made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Making paint from scratch gave me precise control over color
                  and consistency. While it certainly wasn’t the easiest or
                  fastest option, I’m pleased with my results and I’m glad I
                  gave it a try.

                <p>
                  When everything was dry, I attached the hinges and lock
                  mechanism. I did some final touch ups, then packed it up and
                  drove it to Ohio for the wedding!
