                  I was inspired to try building a hobby wood lathe when I
                  acquired a 3/4 HP utility motor. It is capable of turning
                  small parts and separates from its rolling base, which can
                  also be used as a workbench.

                <h2>Building the Lathe</h2>
                <p>
                  I started by making a design in Google Sketchup. The motor
                  powers a shaft with interchangible tools. It slides along a
                  set of tubes to accomodate different size pulleys. The
                  tailstock slides along another tube and is secured with a cam.

                <p>
                  After setting up a makeshift toolrest, I tried shaping a test
                  piece. It cut, but with a truly unnaceptable level of tearout.

                  After bringing the toolrest closer and sharpening my dull
                  chisel, I was satisfied with my new results. The piece still
                  had some tearout, but with the setup I had, I was amazed it
                  worked as well as it did.

                <h2>Designing & Building the Base</h2>
                <p>
                  At this point, I had a semi-functional lathe, but nothing for
                  it to rest on during use. I was also beginning to realize this
                  project was going to take up a lot of space when it was
                  finally done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My solution was a multi-purpose rolling base. The lathe
                  securely bolts into the base during use, but when removed, a
                  tabletop, permanently attached by a hinge at the back,
                  converts the stand into a useful work surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5 nuts are held captive in the base with through holes on the
                  surface. This allowed me to attach various tools, including my
                  vise, drill press and bench grinder to the surface when
                  desired. All of my mounted tools were attached to 3/4" pieces
                  of plywood with the same hole pattern, allowing me to easily
                  mount them at various locations in the shop.

                  With a functioning stand, I clad everything in plywood, to
                  make it safer, protect the workings from debris, and to make
                  it a bit more sightly.

                  The cart rolls on four locking casters, and features storage
                  underneath for tools. The top panel is hinged, allowing acess
                  to the motor when needed.

                  I made a toolrest which adjusts along both horizonal axes.
