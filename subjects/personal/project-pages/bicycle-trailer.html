                  The Bicycle Cargo Trailer was a personal project I developed
                  to help me move heavy or bulky objects (and occasionally
                  passengers) around with my bicycle. I was inspired to build it
                  when I was hauling a salvaged printer on the back of my bike
                  and dropped it at a busy intersection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The attachment had to be sturdy, not impede the motion of the
                  bicycle, and carry a large payload.

                  The first iteration was made from ½” electrical conduit
                  supporting a rubbermaid storage bin and was attached to the
                  back of the bicycle with paracord which could be clipped to an
                  existing rear wheel rack on the bicycle. However, this design
                  was heavy and bulky. Also, flex in the paracord caused the
                  payload to oscillate when the bike experienced large
                  accelerations.

                  The following year, I designed a second iteration which made
                  use of the collapsing mechanism from a walker. It included a
                  larger bin and lightweight aluminum frame as well as direct
                  attachment to the rear wheel of the bike. The frame also
                  folded, allowing me to store it above the wardrobe in my dorm
                  room.
