                  While working as a student shop trainer at Northwestern, I
                  taught a four-hour introductory table saw class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I made an example box ahead of time and guided students
                  through the process, having them cut and assemble pieces
                  during class with the opportunity to come back later and make
                  their own boxes.

                  I wanted to design a project that would let me demonstrate
                  multiple basic features of the table saw, would be feasible in
                  four hours, and would be a safe entry point for beginners. I
                  liked the idea of a six-sided box, because it incorporated
                  angled cuts and showcased the toolâ€™s ability to make precise,
                  repeated cuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also liked how it made use of tiny pieces of junk wood to
                  make something aesthetically pleasing and useful.

                  I put together a packet so that the students (and I) could
                  follow along during the course and have reference material to
                  return to. My hope is that someone who took the class years
                  ago could use the packet at any time as a handy guide to
                  refresh their memory.
