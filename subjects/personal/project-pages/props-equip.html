                  In High School and College, I made films with my friends.
                  Often better than the actual films were the props and
                  equipment we made for them.

                <h2>The Stargate<br />(Spring 2016)</h2>
                <p>
                  In High School, my friends and I shot a Stargate fan film. For
                  it, I constructed a 6 foot diameter portal prop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I built the underlying structure from ½” EMT, which I bent
                  into an octagon. I adhered this frame to a foamboard backing
                  around which I constructed the cardboard and foamboard shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To strengthen the prop, fill in gaps, and make it water
                  resistant for outdoor scenes, I laid a urethane-paper
                  mach&eacutee overtop. This process is effectively the same as
                  regular paper mach&eacutee, but uses polyurethane in place of
                  pva glue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, I finished it with a rock-texture spray paint and
                  wrapped copper-color painted string around 5 points of the
                  prop for the banding.

                <p>
                  My friend and I made a green screen from construction paper
                  and gaff tape, but we were always having issues finding things
                  to hang it from.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I built this frame from ½” EMT and scrap plywood. It comes
                  apart in several places with thumb screws, allowing the frame
                  to be more easily stored or even transported in the back seat
                  of my car.

                <h2>Tunnel in the Wall <br />(Summer 2019)</h2>
                <p>
                  In one film, a character finds a mysterious door behind his
                  couch that leads to a tunnel. To avoid the highly impractical
                  and costly process of digging an actual tunnel, I used a
                  separate tunnel set and editing to craft the effect.

                  I built the tunnel structure out of scrap wood and foamboard.
                  I then lined it with garbage bags to give it a dark,
                  mysterious look.

                  I built a second shorter tunnel in the same room as the other
                  door scenes. When the shot is reversed it appears as if we are
                  looking into the room from a tunnel bored in the wall, though
                  in fact the tunnel and camera are both in front of the wall.
