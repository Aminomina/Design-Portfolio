                  To maximize the usability of the (limited) space in my college
                  apartment, I designed and built custom furniture. It was
                  practical endeavor, but also challenged me to consider the
                  specific design requirements of the space and users
                  (roommates) with in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started each piece by measuring the space where it would go
                  and designing it in Google Sketchup. With the exception of my
                  bed, I built everything from scrap materials and used leftover
                  paint as finish.

                  Iâ€™m a self-described compulsive shelf builder. The challenge
                  of creating efficient vertical organization, all within a
                  structure that must resist bowing, racking, and a myriad of
                  other failure modes is, in my opinion, highly underrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I built all of these shelves out of scrap plywood I got free
                  from a local importing company. My roommates liked them so
                  much, they've now found a permanent place in someone's house!

                  I designed this double-decker unit in order to take full
                  advantage of the horizontal and vertical space in my room. I
                  could have a couch to entertain friends or an extra bed for a
                  guest. It even featured storage above the radiator, which
                  would have otherwise been unusable.

                  I made this coat hook module on a slow day in the machine
                  shop. When I brought it home, I realized it wouldn't stick to
                  my wall, which had a 1/4" dip in it. I scribed the curvature
                  of the wall onto the module and carefully trimmed it on the
                  bandsaw the next day. 9 command adhesive strips later, I had
                  more coat hooks than I even knew what to do with.
