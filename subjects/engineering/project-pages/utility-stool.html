                  I designed a utility seat for a home gardening company in a
                  team of 8 senior Mechanical Engineering students. Our goal was
                  to create a novel product or mechanism that would make
                  gardening easier and more enjoyable for hobbyist gardeners
                  over 50.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We developed three rounds of initial prototypes and one final
                  prototype, each of which we tested with users to redirect and
                  refine our designs. The project involved both engineering
                  analysis and human-centered design, with aspects like comfort
                  and aesthetics having high importance alongside functionality.
                  Although our project was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic,
                  we were still able to deliver a final CAD design and mostly
                  finished working prototype for the company to further develop.

                  We divided into sub teams of two to design and build our first
                  prototypes. This prototype was based off of a concept I
                  created where a rolling cart converts into a stool for compact
                  storage and an alternative use case. Both configurations can
                  be seen with the completed prototype above. I worked on
                  designing the cart and also welded the frame and legs.

                  While users found our first prototype intriguing, they found
                  it too difficult to use and did not think its multiple
                  configurations were necessary. This feedback drove us to seek
                  out simpler designs that still incorporated novel features.

                  This prototype was designed to spin, giving users 360º of
                  motion, and to separate from its base to be used as a kneeler.

                  In the third round, we tried to iron out some of the issues
                  users had with prototype V2C using some new ideas. In
                  prototype V3A, the handles fold down, and the legs also
                  collapse, allowing for flat storage, shipping, and allowing it
                  function as a kneeler without requiring disassembly. Also, a
                  small handle was added to lock the spinning mechanism when not
                  in use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this prototype, I worked on the leg components and their
                  connection to the base. Unfortunately this design was not
                  liked by users because it was difficult to set up and its many
                  moving parts made it unstable.

                  Our final prototype implemented everything we’d learned from
                  the test prototypes. We switched back to a detachable top
                  design, which this time locked onto the base to allow both to
                  be carried at once. The legs use an x-frame design which
                  allows them to easily fold flat for storage, and handles
                  (though they were never constructed) would have folded flat as
                  well. Rubber anti-sink feet would have also been added.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this prototype I designed the leg mechanism and did the
                  welding.
