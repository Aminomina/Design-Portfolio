                  During the
                  <a href="mech-elec.html#smart-watch">Smart Watch Project,</a>
                  which I made for a mechatronics class, I went beyond the scope
                  of the project to design and code my own video game that could
                  run on the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game is coded entirely in C, runs on a PIC32MX170F256B
                  microcontroller, and outputs to a 32x128px OLED display.

                  The game originally ran on a breadboard and was powered by a
                  USB. The circuit contained many components, including a DAC,
                  gyroscope, and additional I/O that were useful for the smart
                  watch, but not necessary for the game.

                  I learned Autodesk Eagle so I could design a custom printed
                  circuit board (PCB) for the game.

                  In order to save space, soldering time, and money, I kept only
                  the microcontroller, OLED display, buttons, on/off switch, and
                  other necessary components.

                  After soldering the components, I noticed an issue. I had
                  originally planned on powering the board with a CR1220
                  battery, but it didn't provide consistent (or long lasting)
                  current.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I purchased a 500mAh rechargable Lithium Polymer (LiPo)
                  battery and surface soldered two wires onto the board for an
                  attachment point.

                  The game runs great now, but still has room for future
                  iterations. Improvements include using fewer through hole
                  components, squeezing components closer together for a smaller
                  footprint, and 3D printing a case to hold everything together
                  and make it look more like a game console.
