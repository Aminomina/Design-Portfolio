                  One of my favorite subfields of Mechanical Engineering is
                  Mechatronics, or the interface of mechanical and electrical
                  systems. Since competing in LEGO robotics in elementary
                  school, I've worked on many different projects, some for
                  classes and some just for fun.

                <p>
                  One of the first mechatronics projects I ever worked on (for a
                  High School Engineering class), this machine does exactly what
                  its name implies: it assembles tasty s'mores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I came up with the concept and basic design for the machine.
                  Two classmates and I refined the design and built it together.

                  While users found our first prototype intriguing, they found
                  it too difficult to use and did not think its multiple
                  configurations were necessary. This feedback drove us to seek
                  out simpler designs that still incorporated novel features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This prototype was designed to spin, giving users 360º of
                  motion, and to separate from its base to be used as a kneeler.

                  In the third round, we tried to iron out some of the issues
                  users had with prototype V2C using some new ideas. In
                  prototype V3A, the handles fold down, and the legs also
                  collapse, allowing for flat storage, shipping, and allowing it
                  function as a kneeler without requiring disassembly. Also, a
                  small handle was added to lock the spinning mechanism when not
                  in use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this prototype, I worked on the leg components and their
                  connection to the base. Unfortunately this design was not
                  liked by users because it was difficult to set up and its many
                  moving parts made it unstable.

                  Our final prototype implemented everything we’d learned from
                  the test prototypes. We switched back to a detachable top
                  design, which this time locked onto the base to allow both to
                  be carried at once. The legs use an x-frame design which
                  allows them to easily fold flat for storage, and handles
                  (though they were never constructed) would have folded flat as
                  well. Rubber anti-sink feet would have also been added.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this prototype I designed the leg mechanism and did the
                  welding.
