                  One of my favorite subfields of Mechanical Engineering is
                  Mechatronics, or the interface of mechanical and electrical
                  systems. Since competing in LEGO robotics in elementary
                  school, I've worked on many different projects, some for
                  classes and some just for fun.

                <p>
                  One of the first mechatronics projects I ever worked on (for a
                  High School Engineering class), this machine does exactly what
                  its name implies: it assembles tasty s'mores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I came up with the concept and basic design for the machine.
                  Two classmates and I refined the design and built it together.

                <p>
                  I designed and built this project as a lighthearted jump-scare
                  for a Halloween maze at my church. Unfortunately, the original
                  video (where it is attached to the maze) is lost, but this
                  recreation demonstrates the monkey spinning after the light
                  sensor is tripped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project runs on a Teensy 3.2 Arduino and the light
                  threshold can be adjusted for different light levels with a
                  potentiometer.

                <p>
                  The basis of this project was to design an autonomous "prey"
                  robot that could flee a piloted "hunter robot" using various
                  sensors, including bump, light, ultrasonic, and VIVE, all
                  running on a Teensy Arduino microcontroller. My largest
                  contributions were designing and building the wheel mounts as
                  well as writing code to control the motors.

                  The goal of this project was to create a fully controllable
                  motor that could be tasked with many different operations,
                  including holding its position at an angle or following a
                  trajectory.

                  The project ran on a PIC32MX795F12H microcontroller and was

                  Although not strictly a mechatronics project, this (perhaps
                  ill-advised) personal project has involved its fair share of
                  wiring and has also taught me lessons about working with
                  higher power DC circuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starting from a replacement motor and control box for a dirt
                  bike, I adapted the system to power my childhood bicycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Future steps include moving some of the batteries over the
                  rear wheel to increase traction, adjusting the mount location
                  of the motor to fix derailing issues, and adding accessories
                  like a speedometer and battery meter (perhaps powered by
                  Arduino). Some guarding around the chain and motor might also
                  be a good idea.

                  The goal of this project was to create a fully functional (but
                  not so wearable) smartwatch powered by a PIC32MX170F256B.
                  Functions include a clock, thermometer, altimeter/gyroscope,
                  input buttons, and LEDs/NeoPixels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I added a simple obstacle game inspired by the Google T-Rex
                  Run game that includes button-activated jumping, collision
                  detection, and randomly spaced obstacles. I later expanded
                  this into <a href="game-doggo.html">its own project.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Future upgrades to the "watch" could include voice
                  recording/playback, a removable SD card, and a settable alarm.
