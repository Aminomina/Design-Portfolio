                  I worked on The Foley Catheter Bag System as part of a
                  freshman design course. I developed it in a team of four for a
                  patient at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab. Our goal was to
                  create a system for wearing a foley catheter bag that was
                  comfortable and easy to use for someone with limited
                  dexterity.

                  The cloth pouch is designed to be comfortable against the leg
                  and more discreet than the unsightly foley bag it contains.
                  All rigid parts can be detached to wash the pouch. Though our
                  prototype was hand sewn, future iterations could be made more
                  robust, allowing the pouch to be machine washable.

                  Our design also features a removable plastic insert to stiffen
                  the opening of the bag while remaining flexible enough to
                  comfortably conform to the user's leg when pressed back into
                  place against a pair of velcro pads. This allows the foley bag
                  to be removed and emptied throughout the day without having to
                  take off the pouch.

                  While I collaborated with my team on the rest of the project,
                  I designed and fabricated the magnetic buckles on my own. My
                  goal was to create a mechanism that could easily be operated
                  by someone with gross motor control, but minimal dexterity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rare earth magnets bring the buckles into alignment, after
                  which the user pushes down a steel clasp. This locks
                  everything in place with a retaining pin. A cloth loop
                  attached to the clasp allows the user to open it by simply
                  sliding in a finger and pulling.
