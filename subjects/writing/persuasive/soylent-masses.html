            <h3>(2021)</h3>
            <p>
              Soylent Green is a 1973 film that takes place in a hot, bleak, and
              overpopulated New York City. The year is 2022 and the runaway
              effects of population growth and greenhouse gas emissions have
              turned the once prosperous city into a living hell. We follow NYPD
              Detective Thorn as he investigates the death of a former board
              member at Soylent, a company which provides food for more than
              half the Earth’s population. Broadly speaking, Soylent Green is
              meant to caution its viewers that their current way of life is not
              sustainable. The film, and the book it was loosely based on, Make
              Room! Make Room! predominantly emphasize the perceived danger of
              unchecked population growth and the world that it might create.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an opening montage, we see images that lead us from some time
              in the 1800s to the industrial revolution all the way to the time
              of the film. As it progresses, we are shown a rapidly growing
              number of people as well as an increasing presence and quantity of
              technology. Finally, we see an establishing shot that tells us we
              are in New York in the year 2022, and the city’s population is
              40,000,000. From here, we follow Thorn on his case, seeing sweaty
              people crammed in stairwells, riots breaking out when food rations
              run low, and only the rich having access to things many of us take
              for granted, like apples and running water.
            </p>

              Thorn lives in a small apartment with his co-worker and friend
              Sol. (there might be a paternal/romantic dynamic there, too) After
              Sol does some research and Thorn does some investigating, it
              becomes increasingly clear that the death was an inside job by
              Soylent. Upon realizing a mysterious truth, Sol goes to a
              euthanasia clinic and Thorn secretly hitches a ride on a truck
              carrying away the dead bodies. Here, he discovers what Sol already
              figured out: Soylent Green, people’s favorite food ration, is made
              out of those very dead people. But this harrowing revelation only
              hammers home the message we’ve been getting throughout the whole
              film: uncontrolled population and production will turn the human
              population into disposable livestock. Thorn too, realizes this,
              saying “Soon they’ll be breeding us like cattle.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the film, the mass overpopulation is framed as an
              accidental problem, one seemingly already looming in the year the
              film was released. Even Sol, who saw it all unfold, asks, with
              tears in his eyes, “How’d we get to this?” He hints at an answer a
              bit later when he says that “People were always rotten, but the
              Earth was beautiful.” This implies a sort of inevitability to the
              problem. People are bad, and at a certain point, there’s enough of
              them that the Earth reaches a breaking point. There’s really no
              solution, at the time of the film or in the events leading up to
              it, that doesn’t involve controlling the human population. No one
              is accountable except for the masses themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the elephant in the room is what Soylent, the immediate
              antagonist of the film, represents: powerful, oppressive companies
              that feel no empathy towards those masses. From a (non-fictional)
              twenty-first century perspective, the film almost seems remiss for
              not letting such a company play a role in humanity’s demise. The
              closest they come is in depicting just how much influence Soylent
              has at the time of the film, assassinating a former board member
              of theirs and simply paying off the police to close the case. It
              isn’t hard to see how they benefit from the hellish conditions of
              the world. Their entire business, after all, is producing bland
              food pellets no one would ever even want in better times. But the
              film doesn’t go quite so far as to blame Soylent for this fall.
              The company’s only fault is taking advantage of the situation to
              make money in unethical ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a way the film is almost mildly sympathetic to Soylent. Right
              before a wounded and shaken Thorn delivers his iconic line in the
              final scene (“Soylent Green is made out of people!”) he remarks:
              “ocean’s dying, plankton’s dying.” This is learned from Sol’s
              research into an oceanographic report made by Soylent. It sets up
              a rational, understandable reason for Soylent to turn to the dead
              as a food source. They simply can’t meet the demand any other way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The year is 2020, and it doesn’t seem like we’re headed for a
              world like the one depicted in Soylent Green anytime soon.
              According to U.S. Census data, New York’s population was about
              7,895,000 in 1970, three years before the film was released.
              Instead of a population increase of more than 32 million, the city
              has failed to grow by even 1 million people in that time. Where it
              was accurate was its portrayal of climate change as a serious
              issue. Perhaps the mismatch comes from its failure to acknowledge
              the reality that wealthier people and nations leave a far larger
              environmental footprint than their poorer counterparts. So in a
              way, by blaming unchecked population growth over the
              overconsumption of the wealthy few, the blame was pointed at the
              wrong people. Today, it is better understood that the problem is
              more complicated than a simple relationship between population and
              production, and that social justice plays also an important role
              in decreasing our impact on the planet.
