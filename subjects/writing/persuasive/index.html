            With its history of excluding women, and especially in the US,
            racial minorities, it should come as no surprise that LGBTQ
            individuals are also under-represented in STEM fields. Like other
            minorities, LGBTQ people do not fit within the traditional
            heterosexual white male narrative of STEM in the US. However, sexual
            identity can be more complicated than race or gender. Often, it is
            invisible in academic or professional settings, and its intersection
            with other identities creates many unique kinds of LGBTQ people.
