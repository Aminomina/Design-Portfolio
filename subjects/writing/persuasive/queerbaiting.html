            <h2>“Queerbaiting” in Blockbuster Cinema</h2>
            <h3>(2020, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              People who have seen recent major motion pictures like Avengers
              Endgame or Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker may or may not have
              noticed the LGBTQ representation in these films. In the first,
              this representation comes in the form of a side character’s
              anecdote, in which he uses the pronoun “he” when describing a
              recent date. The second consists of a two-second kiss between
              female background characters. These “blink and you’ll miss it”
              scenes, sometimes called “queerbaiting,” are popular among
              moviemakers who want to capitalize on the queer community’s desire
              to be seen without being too overt. In analyzing the lack of LGBTQ
              representation in major motion pictures, it becomes evident that
              there are multiple reasons for this phenomenon, including
              historical precedent, appeal to global markets, and internal
              biases of filmmakers due to their own backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Filmmakers face little friction for queerbaiting since the
              historical precedent is no representation at all. It wasn’t until
              recently that major motion pictures were even allowed to portray
              queer characters in a positive light. Under Will Hayes, the Motion
              Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) began to
              severely limit what could be depicted in film. The Motion Picture
              Production Code, enacted in the early 1930s, states: “sex
              perversion or any inference to it is forbidden,” (“The Motion
              Picture Production Code” 1930, 3) refering to anything outside of
              the cisgender heterosexual norm. This code was strictly enforced
              for decades, rendering LGBTQ representation effectively impossible
              during the golden age of cinema. But as the code fell out of
              practice, lack of queer representation did not. While there were
              likely other factors involved, it’s not a stretch to say the code
              had already done its damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the foremost reason why LGBTQ representation is so
              limited in big budget cinema is the demographic makeup of creative
              decision makers themselves. According to a study from 2007 to 2017
              (Dry 2017), 95.7% of film directors were male. While the same
              study had data on LGB representation within film, such as only 19
              of the top 100 films in 2017 containing even one LGB character,
              there was no data available, in this study or any others I could
              find, that mentioned LGBTQ representation in director, writer, and
              producer roles. While out LGBTQ directors exist, they typically
              helm smaller films that don’t catch the public eye, like festival
              films. Meanwhile, mainstream cinema is dominated by cisgender,
              straight, white men, for whom LGBTQ representation is simply not
              as important as it is for those within the community.X
            </p>
            <p>
              Most filmmakers are motivated by capturing profitable markets,
              historical precedent, and their own internal biases. At worst,
              this means no or negative representation. At best, it means tiny
              crumbs, hidden from the general audience. Ironically, by
              portraying LGBTQ people in nearly invisible roles, the films
              condemn the characters to the same fate as many of the viewers
              they’re meant to represent: erasure. When asked the underwhelming
              amount of queer representation in Avengers Endgame, Kevin Feige,
              president of Marvel Studios, claimed that “[inclusivity is] coming
              and that there’s much more prominent LGBT heroes in the future.”
              Time will tell if the studio will follow through on this promise.
              Ultimately, widespread positive representation will not come until
              studios let members of the LGBTQ community into the creative
              process. That would mean a major ethical shift for studios, but it
              would also bring diverse perspectives and new narratives to big
              budget cinema, narratives that want to be told and heard.
