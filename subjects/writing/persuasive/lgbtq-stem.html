            <h2>LGBTQ People in STEM</h2>
            <h3>(2020, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              With its history of excluding women, and especially in the US,
              racial minorities, it should come as no surprise that LGBTQ
              individuals are also under-represented in STEM fields. Like other
              minorities, LGBTQ people do not fit within the traditional
              heterosexual white male narrative of STEM in the US. However,
              sexual identity can be more complicated than race or gender.
              Often, it is invisible in academic or professional settings, and
              its intersection with other identities creates many unique kinds
              of LGBTQ people. The concept of sexual identity itself, compared
              to race and gender, is relatively new. This raises the question:
              In what ways are LGBTQ individuals excluded in STEM fields? With
              its history of excluding women, racial minorities, and people of
              lesser economic means, the STEM community’s exclusion of sexual
              minorities falls in line with their typical behavior. These
              factors produce an inhospitable environment for LGBTQ people
              studying STEM, in STEM academia and other STEM careers.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the moment LGBTQ individuals decide to pursue a degree in
              STEM, they encounter an uphill battle in a heterosexist
              environment. According to a 2018 study, LGBTQ students were
              actually more likely to engage in undergraduate research than
              their heterosexual peers, an act which signifies a stronger
              commitment to their area of study. It also corresponds with a
              13.46% increased likelihood of remaining in STEM for the general
              population of students. However, LGBTQ students were 9.54% less
              likely to stay in STEM (Hughes 2018). This points to forces beyond
              the LGBTQ students themselves, both interpersonal and cultural,
              which drive them away from their chosen field of study. A 2011
              study found that in the field of Engineering especially, LGB
              issues can be seen as “social” and therefore irrelevant to a
              highly technical, professionally minded student body (Cech 2011).
              Such a climate favors students within the sexual majority who
              don’t regularly worry about these issues and who are advantaged by
              the current system. Meanwhile, it dismisses and alienates LGBTQ
              students and their concerns.

              Of the LGBTQ students who do graduate with a degree in STEM, many
              go on to face even more friction in their work environments.
              According to a 2009 study, LGBT people often feel invisible
              because personal lives aren’t discussed very much in their
              workplaces, and a heterosexual norm is assumed. Additionally,
              pressure is often exerted on these individuals to keep their
              identities hidden. One interviewee was told “to be more
              conservative in appearance, not to bring her partner to department
              events, and not to adopt children” (Bilimoria et. al. 2009,
              90-91). Such demands not only force an employee to conceal their
              personal life in ways that other employees would never have to,
              but may even force them to refrain from making personal life
              choices at the risk of losing their job. In absolutely no scenario
              would a cisgender heterosexual person be asked to make such a
              compromise. In a 2015 study of federal agencies, it was found that
              LGBT professionals in STEM had significantly worse workplace
              experiences than their cisgender, heterosexual coworkers, with
              measures such as transparent evaluations, respect from
              supervisors, and support of work-life balance. Using the same
              measures, it was found that LGBT people in non-STEM-related
              agencies had generally more positive workplace experiences (Cech
              2015). Discrimination is also experienced by LGBT people in other
              fields, but within STEM, it is particularly pronounced.

              Ultimately, the broader community must acknowledge that LGBTQ
              issues are relavent, even in contexts where personal and social
              issues are supposedly not. LGBTQ people are disadvantaged by
              pressure to stay silent, microaggressions, and an unwelcoming
              environment that has been formed with the sexual majority in mind.
              One step towards this is breeding a healthier culture of talking
              about life at work. There is a time for getting work done, but
              frequently, there is time to converse. The notion that speaking
              about personal life in the workplace is unprofessional,
              particularly when one’s lifestyle is different from the norm, is a
              rule that tacitly benefits the majority. Ultimately getting more
              queer people involved in STEM will be the greatest help. With
              greater numbers, the rest of the community will be able to get
              used to their presence, and having more role models will help
              young LGBTQ people stay around to become part of the community
              themselves.
