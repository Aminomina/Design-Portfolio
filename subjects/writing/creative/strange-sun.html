            <h2>Strange Things Under the Midnight Sun</h2>
            <h3>(2018, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              Restless, Roberta E. Knick pressed her forehead against the little
              airplane window. Between periodic red flashes on the wing she
              could spy the twinkling, fluorescent stars. It would have made a
              great night for stargazing, she thought, and it was absolutely
              killing her to be inside the cloistered up tin can of a plane.
            </p>
            <p>
              But no matter. In less than thirty-six hours she would be free
              from small windows and light pollution for quite some time. Oh
              yes. She was Arctic-bound, and wild horses nor naysayers of
              greater wisdom could stop her. The little prop passenger plane,
              one of the last of its kind, was en route to Churchill, Manitoba,
              and it was there that her more than nine month journey would
              begin. Once she’d left people behind and entered the land of harsh
              storms and polar bears, she’d have the night sky all to herself.
              Well, once there was night again. So that would be at least a few
              months, but, regardless...
            </p>
            <p>
              It was all too exciting and she couldn’t calm down. Normally noted
              for her stoicism, Robbie transformed on the eve of adventure.
              Though it was one o’clock in the morning she was beyond restless.
              She was rattling and boiling over, intensely giddy almost to the
              point of sickness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Times like this brought out a side in her few people ever saw, for
              none were crazy enough to follow her. It was well known that
              Robbie took daredevilry to treacherous extremes, and was oft to
              return less than unscathed from her mad escapades. There was the
              broken leg on Denali, the third degree burns when the wildfires
              broke out in the West, and then of course the infamous
              trans-Pacific incident.
            </p>
            <p>
              Robbie had set off from Papua New Guinea in May, in a kayak, and
              six months later, even her family began to wonder where she was
              when they received neither call nor visit at Thanksgiving. Once
              they’d tracked down some of her friends and extracted the few
              details they could about her planned route, they had search
              parties out and helicopters patrolling the skies. But it was no
              use. The ocean was too vast, and Robbie could be anywhere. Four
              months later, long after she was declared dead, Robbie showed up
              nine hundred miles South of target in Peru. She had been
              “sidetracked.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet always, she returned. Never carried out, never rescued, but on
              her own two feet. And no matter how close she had come to death,
              she went out and did it again. The woman was indestructible.
