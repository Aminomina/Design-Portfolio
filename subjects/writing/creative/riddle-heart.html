            <h2>Riddle in the Tree's Heart</h2>
            <h3>(2017, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              He walked down the street with resounding footsteps, completely
              alone, for it was still early, and no one else was about. The sun
              had not even risen over the Eastern Mountains, and its light could
              barely be seen through the clouds in the lower part of the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was just like the day of the funeral. He walked down the same
              worn out roads, head bowed under the rolling gray front above him.
              And when he reached the dirt road, it began to rain. As if memory
              and reality were determined to worsen his memory of the day, the
              sky was even drearier, and the rain much colder, freezing as it
              landed around him.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the time he reached the cemetery, his feet were cold and stiff
              from the icy water that had soaked through his shoes. His hand,
              too, covered in a slick layer of water he almost confused for ice,
              felt frozen and clammy around his cane. Trying to keep his face
              out of the weather, he pressed his chin firmly against his chest,
              eyes pointed at his toes. Every so often, he looked up briefly to
              see where he was walking, and to ensure he wouldn’t pass his
              family’s plot. About one hundred paces away from it, he glanced
              up. It was only for a brief second, but he could have sworn he saw
              a dark figure crouching over one of the headstones. The thing wore
              a black cloak. But for his family? Impossible, Denny was the last
              of his line. No one but he mourned that plot. Then his thoughts
              wandered to the night before. Perhaps it was the phantom, there to
              mock him once more in his loneliness and childlessness. She would
              look at him, saying nothing, but her eyes would ask him that
              piercing question, ‘Why are you so alone? It is no one’s fault but
              your own.’ But she was not real. It was only an illusion in his
              mind. If he glanced again, she would be gone.
            </p>
            <p>
              He took ten steps, then fifteen, then twenty, trying to hold out
              as long as he could. Finally, when the tips of his shoes were no
              more than five meters away from the grave, he looked up. It was
              there, as real as anything he had ever beheld. The cloak was
              tattered and threadbare near the edges, but as black as moonless
              night. From it, a single arm extended whose hand was yellow-green.
              Denny, trembling to his core, reached out with his own shriveled
              hand, and touched the thing. It did not disappear, nor turn to
              wisps or lose its form. It was of flesh, or something comparable,
              for it jerked its back in fear, and in a split second, was fleeing
              for the woods again.
