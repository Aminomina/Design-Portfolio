            <h2>Solia's Revenge</h2>
            <h3>(2020, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              When Solia was still about a half-mile away, a figure emerged, and
              hugging the rock wall, she took another look through her
              binoculars. There he was, the bastard, the coward Little Jake
              himself. He looked oddly peaceful, if a bit tired. For a moment,
              he watched the horizon while smoking a pen, then hustled back
              inside.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now was her chance. Quickening her pace, Solia closed the
              remaining distance. She stood outside the door for a moment, red
              and panting, then kicked it open with rifle in hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were four of them. The ranch hand and an older child of
              maybe ten were standing by a pot on the stove. Little Jake held a
              little one, who began to cry. She recognized a dread in her
              brother's eyes, as if he'd been expecting this moment for a long
              time. The ranch hand reached for a pistol at his hip, but Little
              Jake stopped him. Without taking his eyes off Solia, he passed the
              child to his partner and stood, arms raised.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I know you're angry.” His voice faltered. “You've got a right.
              But the ranch is yours. Everything is. I transferred it over
              before leaving. I know it can't change the past, but please,
              Solly, don't hurt my family. This is between us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Solia was shaking. Sweat streamed into her collar. She gripped the
              gun tight, but said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Let's do this out back, ok? For their sake. Don't make 'em
              watch.” Little Jake shifted his weight nervously from one foot to
              the other.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a cautious moment, he inched to the door and gingerly pushed
              it open. Solia followed close behind, averting her eyes from the
              children in the corner. Little Jake made his way around back and
              stopped beside the rock wall, clutching his heart and looking to
              the sky. After nearly thirty years he'd finally caught himself
              thinking O'fiver was beautiful. Warily, his gaze drifted down to
              his sister, ten paces away with her finger on the trigger.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solia was still. Memories flashed by her like she was riding past
              them on a wingbike. Isaac bleeding out, rustlers laughing. The
              horror in Becca's eyes as Little Jake lay on the courtroom floor
              begging, “Please, Solly, please Solly, no!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Under witness of the vast orange desert and the scorching hot
              alien sun, Solia dropped her coil rifle and turned away. Jake's
              heart fluttered as the gun hit the dust. Blood rushed violently to
              his head and his legs gave out. Not knowing if he'd been shot or
              spared, he watched his sister going off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refusing to look back, Solia ran away from the little shack and
              its inhabitants. There was a happiness they had that she could
              never find, not through revenge, likely never at all. Tears fell
              off her chin and evaporated on the dry sand as she made her way
              back to the bike.
