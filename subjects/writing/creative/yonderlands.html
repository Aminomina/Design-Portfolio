            <h2>The Yonderlands</h2>
            <h3>(2018, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              The old locust tree loomed over him, reaching high into the barren
              indigo sky, a towering ‘V’ at the end of the clearing. Its pale
              leaves rustled gently and rhythmically, as if the great beast was
              waiting for him and the night’s hot breath was its own. The
              disheveled traveler continued, departing the shaded protection of
              the forest to venture into dancing prairie grass. The moon, though
              waning, shone brightly through the clouds and trickled onto white
              hair, sleek as fur.
            </p>

              He knew a town was nearby. First he’d seen cuts on the great trees
              and old, dusty cake-wood stumps that still bore the imprint of the
              ax. Then trash, not the old kind, but fresh, new world garbage:
              heaps of broken animal bones, canvas tarps full of holes, broken
              implements. Even shattered glass. It must be quite a settlement,
              he thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he reached what had looked like the end of the strip, the
              field opened up to the left and he could see a great stretch of
              land with rows of crops, little dirt roads, and the faint outline
              of buildings in the distance. The glowing moon, now faintly
              visible, led the way. So he turned and bid goodbye to the old
              locust, hoped it might wish him luck, then tread silently onward.
            </p>

              High upon his platform, the guard followed the little spec of a
              man across the plain. He approached slowly, limping as an injured
              beast. His shredded rags flicked and settled, flicked and settled
              as the breeze rolled over the switchgrass in waves. A little dab
              of silver hair bobbed up and down as if it were a separate thing,
              though firmly attached to his head like the bristles of a wire
              brush. He must be old, the guard thought. Yes, a sturdy old man,
              for sturdy he must have been to make it this far.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the time the stranger reached tilled land, Jeddison, the
              village head, had been roused. The distant fellow looked up every
              and then as he approached, eying the little congregation that
              waited for him. When he was sufficiently close, Jed and the guard
              closed the distance and met him on the trail. When the man looked
              up they were surprised to see a youthful, though weatherworn face.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You look very weary, traveler,” said the old head, his
              interrupted sleep apparent. “This is Harvest.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The stranger remained motionless, peering deep into them with dull
              blue eyes before half answering.
            </p>
            <p>“Yes, I have come far.”</p>
            <p>
              Stricken by the young man’s cold demeanor, Jed searched for an
              appropriate invitation.
            </p>
            <p>“Are you alright, son? You limp, have you been injured?”</p>
            <p>White hair’s eyes livened.</p>
            <p>“No. No, it’s just been a long way.”</p>
            <p>“No doubt. Well, follow me. We’ll check in tomorrow.”</p>
            <p>
              He led the way back, slowly down the old dirt road, past the many
              rows of crops and into the village. The newcomer was directed into
              a disintegrated hut, and a guard was posted outside to watch him.
