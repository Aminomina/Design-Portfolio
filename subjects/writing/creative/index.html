            Already spooked, the rustlers retreated to the rig as Isaac yelled
            “Git!” and led the ranch hands in a charge. And just like that, it
            happened. Turning, one of the rustlers fired before jumping into the
            back of the truck. Isaac stopped short. The ranch hands kept
            running, hooting and hollering as the rig drove up towards the
            ridge. Isaac felt the bloody hole in his belly, then fell into the
            dry earth with a thud. He lasted one night in the infirmary, and
            then, clutching his weeping daughter's hand, passed away at first
            light.

              When Solia was still about a half-mile away, a figure emerged, and

              The old locust tree loomed over him, reaching high into the barren
              indigo sky, a towering ‘V’ at the end of the clearing. Its pale
