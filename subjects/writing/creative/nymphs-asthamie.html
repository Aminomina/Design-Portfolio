            <h2>The Nymphs of Asthamie</h2>
            <h3>(2021, Excerpt)</h3>
            <p>
              Safely out of the planet’s atmosphere, Margot let off the throttle
              and turned on autopilot. Outside her viewport on the starboard
              side of the ship, she could see the transport security shuttle
              following close behind. With an OK over the radio, she turned off
              comms and leaned back in her seat. What a strange little planet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The client’s security personnel had already been there when she
              landed and were overseeing the process. Some workers were misting
              the product with some kind of chemical in preparation of loading
              it. Saplings, they looked like, but balled up at the bottom, as if
              the roots were clenched in a fist. They looked strange to Margot,
              like everything on the planet. The purple flora, the fluttering
              insects––for that was the only other life she could see––were
              somehow uncanny. And though she couldn’t explain it, the
              surrounding forest and low-hanging clouds felt more claustrophobic
              than the inside of the cockpit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Golan, the head security officer, curtly motioned her over for
              instructions. They sternly reminded her the importance of the
              product arriving intact, briskly assuring they would take care of
              any external threats and that her job was solely to take off
              carefully, land more carefully, and not muck anything up in
              between. Also, although it shouldn’t happen, if the product were
              to arrive in worse condition than it left, she should expect a
              significant cut to her pay and even legal action as necessary.
              Margot nodded respectfully. Even for a Drogan, they were
              insensitive and rude.
            </p>
            <p>
              Setting an alarm for her next security check-in, she gazed at the
              abysmal sky for some time before getting up to stretch her legs.
              As she moved toward the back of the cockpit, she finally saw it,
              leaning against the back of her seat. But what was it doing there?
              The cargo hold wasn’t connected on the inside. Had it been put
              there by mistake? Or perhaps on purpose, as some kind of joke?
              Surely not. The workers had been very careful in loading them. And
              yet, there it was, as plain as day. A knobby, purple leafed
              Asthamian laurel.
