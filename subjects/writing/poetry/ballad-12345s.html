            <h2>Ballad of the 12345s</h2>
            <h3>(2021)</h3>
            <p>
              Verse 1: <br />
              Gather now my people as I spin a woeful yarn <br />
              Of the gruesomest, fiercest creatures that ever touched the stars.
              <br />
              I’ve sailed across the galaxy, seen everything alive, <br />
              But I’ve never seen anything quite as strange as the 12345s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chorus 1: <br />
              Captain Myscalabie was I, <br />
              I sailed the finest ship there ever was across the midnight sky.
              <br />
              And all aboard were brave and true as we sailed the waters blue
              <br />
              In the great wide sea above the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Verse 2: <br />
              We set off from the homeworld, left everything we knew. <br />
              To defend our people’s honor and avenge that fated crew. <br />
              A peaceful ship of diplomats was docked when they arrived, <br />
              But then they were all murdered by the 12345s.
            </p>
            <p>Chorus 1</p>
            <p>
              Verse 3: <br />
              Their ships were in the distance. The armadas had arrived <br />
              To see who’d be the victor or who’d be left alive. <br />
              We fought beside the others and made our people proud <br />
              But we took an impact to the hull and our battleship went down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chorus 2: <br />
              Captain Myscalabie was I, <br />
              I sailed the finest ship there ever was across the midnight sky.
              <br />
              And all aboard were brave and true as we split up in the blue
              <br />
              In the great wide sea above the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Verse 4: <br />
              5 is for their fingers that take all that they can, <br />
              4 is for their legs and arms on which they shoot and stand, <br />
              3 their crimson vessels and 2 their piercing eyes, <br />
              1 is for their wicked hearts that let my people die.
            </p>
            <p>Chorus 1</p>
