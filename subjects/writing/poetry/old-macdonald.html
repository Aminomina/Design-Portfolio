            <h2>Old MacDonald</h2>
            <h3>(2021)</h3>
            <p>
              Old MacDonald had a farm, EIEIOH <br />
              But that was many years ago, EIEIOH.
            </p>
            <p>
              Late one year when winter came, the barn was full of hay. <br />
              But his cow knocked an oil lamp down; the barn went up in flames.
              <br />
              With fire here, fire there, <br />
              Here fire. There fire. Everywhere fire. <br />
              Old MacDonald’s livestock ran, EIEIOH.
            </p>
            <p>
              The farmer started to the door, but age had made him slow. <br />
              A beam came down and pinned his leg, his sight began to go. <br />
              With a white flash here and a bright light there. <br />
              All at once his whole life played out everywhere. <br />
              Old MacDonald went out cold. EIEIOH.
            </p>
            <p>
              He woke up in a hospital, his farm was far away. <br />
              “My animals,” he cried out, but the nurses made him stay. <br />
              With a lesion here, and a fracture there, <br />
              Here a drain, there a drain, third degree burns everywhere. <br />
              Old MacDonald barely lived. EIEIOH.
            </p>
            <p>
              There wasn’t money for the bills, the farm he had to sell. <br />
              He moved into a nursing home, but didn’t fare so well. <br />
              With no-one here, no-one there, <br />
              Not a friend or visitor to be seen anywhere. <br />
              Old MacDonald was alone. EIEIOH.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the twilight of his years he made but one more call, <br />
              To see the place that was his farm where now there stood a mall.
              <br />
              With a Macy’s here, and a Spencers there, <br />
              Here a stand, there a stand, people standing everywhere. <br />
              Old MacDonald shed a tear. EIEIOH.
