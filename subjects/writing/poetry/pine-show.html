            <p>
              Welcome to the pine creek radio show, <br />
              It’s a pleasure to be on tonight. <br />
              I come to you from the land of blue, <br />
              and I hope you’re feeling right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Welcome to the pine creek radio show, <br />
              to the folks both far and near, <br />
              If you’re ever in town you can come around <br />
              It’d be a pleasure to have you here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Been trudgin’ these worn old boots all day, <br />
              And I’m standing on tired feet, <br />
              But I can’t complain with this roof o’er my head <br />
              And plenty of food to eat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well there ain’t much left of the old stuff now, <br />
              But the crops did good for me <br />
              There’s been many a gal with a much worse lot, <br />
              But it ain’t like it used to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              I ain’t had no E since ’73, <br />
              ‘Cuz there ain’t none left in town. <br />
              It’s been a damn hard life and a long hard road <br />
              Since good old glory went down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well I’m settling down in this little old shed, <br />
              Because winter’s around the bend, <br />
              I’ve got all I need right here with me, <br />
              ‘xcept a soul to be my friend.
            </p>
