            <h2>Riddles</h2>
            <p>
              I rise up in flame, then downwards I go <br />
              And I am defeated with only one blow.
            </p>
            <p>
              I repeat many times in the lives of men. <br />
              My hands do the motions again and again. <br />
              I have no feet to roam where I may <br />
              But I run in a circle two times every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born of the land, lives in the sea. <br />
              It drifts with the wind, yet it is not free. <br />
              It kisses the sky with its great wings of white, <br />
              But this heavy leviathan never takes flight.
            </p>
            <p>
              The titan of the river stands <br />
              With planted feet and outstretched hands. <br />
              She guards the waters down below <br />
              As swiftly past her legs they go. <br />
              A friend she is to travelers, <br />
              But greeting them she never stirs. <br />
              They climb upon her shoulders lank <br />
              And thus they pass from bank to bank.
            </p>
            <p>
              Expression it has, thinking it lacks. <br />
              One learns many things by reading its tracks. <br />
              First of tree, then of bird, then of plastic and steel, <br />
              It has power to hurt, but also to heal. <br />
              It waxes strong by the light of man <br />
              Yet daily is bled by the stroke of his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              I reach for the sky and delve in the earth <br />
              Quite sturdy am I and great is my girth. <br />
              Yet they hew my corpse, they harvest my blood, <br />
              They ravage my home leaving nothing but mud. <br />
              Sometimes oâ€™er my grave they lay great piles of stone, <br />
              But beneath them is neither a coffin nor bone.
            </p>
            <p>
              What bites with speed through flesh and bone <br />
              Yet has no teeth to call its own? <br />
              Beneath its guard a hand grabs hold <br />
              And takes it as a chime is tolled.
            </p>
            <p>
              I stand out in darkness, am hidden by day. <br />
              The seeker I aid and the thief I betray. <br />
              I have power to save in the bleak of night, <br />
              Yet many there are I send into flight. <br />
              So small am I in a hand I may lie, <br />
              Yet people will flinch if they meet my eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can be large, though I start out small. <br />
              My breathing tongues are what make me tall. <br />
              I beat my foes down as I struggles to rise, <br />
              Coughing up soot as I lick the skies. <br />
              Man is my friend but I tear his work down, <br />
              Eat up his fields and ruin his town.
            </p>
            <p>
              A bed of many blades there lies upon an open stretch <br />
              Whose many readied blades on no one's flesh will ever catch.
              <br />
              They bend and stoop beneath the feet of those who travel by,
              <br />
              Then, when alone they stand upright and rise to meet the sky.
              <br />
              These blades dig deep and splinter out but not in flesh or bone,
              <br />
              Though great machines run through the ranks, and every tip they
              hone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Few folks can say they ever saw <br />
              A part of me, save mouth or jaw. <br />
              I open these with little din <br />
              And they, undaunted, wander in. <br />
              I shut my mouth and, them in tow, <br />
              High up above the ground I go. <br />
              Or down I dive and there I cease, <br />
              Where those that entered I release. <br />
              (I give them but one parting cry. <br />
              A single chime is my goodbye.)
