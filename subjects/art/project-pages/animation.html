                  As a lifelong lover of animation, I had to give it a try
                  myself. This section contains my experiments and projects in
                  animation.

                <p>
                  The bouncing ball is a classic introduction to animation. The
                  ball rises and falls parabolically with respect to time in the
                  air and deforms (losing very little volume) as it strikes the
                  ground. For the sake of artistic portrayal, these physics can
                  be exaggerated.

                  I wanted to see how few frames (only 7!) I could convey a
                  running motion in. I made a 3D reference video in advance to
                  make drawing the low angle easier.

                  I made this animation to test syncing existing dialogue with
                  animation. The audio clip is from the film “The Incredible
                  Sock Man,” which my friends and I filmed between High School
                  and College.

                <p>
                  An inventor contemplates his imminent demise at the hands of
                  his own creation, the water sausage.

                  The audio is from a video I made at summer camp in 2013 in
                  which other campers ganged up on me with water baloons made of
                  the tubular plastic bags our new cots came in, an idea I had
                  originally come up with.

                  My end goal in learning animation is to create my own short
                  films. This film would be a slice-of-life story about a girl
                  growing up to become a scientist, framed through the lens of
                  her graphing calculator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The story is inspired by my own TI-84 Silver Edition
                  calculator I've had since 5th grade and still use today!

                  While the characters and select objects were drawn in 2D, most
                  of the background, including decorative objects, are
                  cel-shaded 3D models.

                <p>
                  Though more time-consuming initially, this technique allows me
                  to rearrange/reuse objects, shoot backgrounds from any angle,
                  and even move the camera without having to manually animate
                  the background.
