                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                  My name is Anna Lugthart, I’m a Mechanical Engineer, and I’m
                  passionate about design! I'm endlessly fascinated by
                  engineering, art, writing, and honestly most other things I
                  try. Above all, I love learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had the privilege of studying at Northwestern University,
                  where I learned engineering principles that extended the reach
                  of my creativity. During that time, I also worked at the Ford
                  Prototyping Lab where I gained valuable skills in fabrication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years I’ve worked on many design projects and other
                  creative endeavors. Some were for work, some were for school,
                  and some were just for me. Many of those projects can be found
                  right here in this portfolio.

                <h2>About this Portfolio</h2>
                <p>
                  I coded this portfolio from scratch using HTML, CSS, and
                  JavaScript. After taking a web development course, I decided
                  to design a portfolio in order to practice my learnings in the
                  context of a useful project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I aim to maintain modular, easy-to-read code that can evolve
                  along with my needs for this site. Except where otherwise
                  notated, all code was authored by me.
                </p>
